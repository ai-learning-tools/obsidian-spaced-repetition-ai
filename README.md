# Spaced Repetition AI Plugin (SRAI)

SRAI is a flashcard generation and review plugin in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It uses spaced repetition and AI to help you remember your notes for the long-term.

Important note: this plugin will add a folder called `SR` to your vault. It contains files that track the spaced repetition cards for each file detected in your vault. 

## Features

It does all of this:

1. Add your flashcards directly in your Obsidian notes with tracking
2. Review your flashcards with the best spaced repetition algorithm ever, called FSRS (based on thousands of Anki reviews)
3. Generate flashcards from your notes using AI
You can use just review or generation, or both depending on what you need.

We use an algorithm called FSRS for spaced repetition scheduling, and OpenAI for flashcard generation.
